Omni Financial Healthcare provides pre-settlement cash advances and procedure payments for plaintiffs and medical facilities. The company moved its case management to a more robust, custom built system. The system coordinates paying for medical procedures needed for clients, attorneys giving updates on existing cases and finalizing the settlement for cases won, insurance demands, and helping medical facilities keep track of personal injury cases.
