# First Fruits Finance Donation Management System for non-profits
[Back](../README.md)

Started as a collaboration with my brothers, First Fruits Finance Donation Management was created to assist a local church with tracking their donations and sending the end of year giving statements.

## Description
The system helps keep track of the people who donate and when and how much is donated. The are options for grouping contacts into a single household, splitting a single donation to different funds, anonymous donations, and custom giving statement templates.

The system was hosted on an Azure web service and database. Some work was put in for a web application to spin up a new web service and domain for additional non-profits.

## My Contribution
At the beginning, I assisted in building up the database models and the initial queries for searching for donations and contacts. Once the initial application was setup and working, I assisted in customizing the look and feel of the website.

I helped design the contact and donation history tracking, splitting a single donation to different funds, and tracking multiple phone numbers for a contact. Working with the EntityFramework to access the database, the back end to process the information, the front end interactiong and display, and thoroughly testing every part stretched my ability to manage multiple parts of a single feature.
