# Case Management System for Omni Financial Healthcare, LLC (now The Trio Solution)
[Back](../README.md)

Omni Financial Healthcare provides pre-settlement cash advances and procedure payments for plaintiffs and medical facilities. The company moved its case management to a more robust, custom built system.

## Description
The system, known as CaseMaster, coordinates paying for medical procedures needed for clients, attorneys giving updates on existing cases and finalizing the settlement for cases won, insurance demands, and helping medical facilities keep track of personal injury cases.

## My Contribution
Initially, I was brought onto the team to help finalize the initial requirements for CaseMaster. This included working with the various company departments to understand their individual needs for the system, how the departments work together, and the necessary flow of information.

Once the initial requirements were collected and understood, they were then turned into tasks for the developers, myself included. From front end design, to back end processing, to database development, to document generation, I worked on various tasks and assisted other developers in understanding the requirements and testing code changes.

After CaseMaster went live, there were still development tasks to be done. The finance and accounting department was not part of the initial transition and required more analysis for their requirements. I worked with a small team to rebuild all of the bank required reports into the new system, verifying the historical data was accurate.

In addition to this, I also created the initial user manual for the employees. This detailed where everything moved to in the new system and how things changed in the system, including the process for different departments. One year later, after many changes and improvements, I remade the user manual with the updated information.
